TESTING

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mercedes. 2025 is special because I started it as a new Hubber! ðŸ˜ƒ
I haven't used Github in previous roles before (I'm non-technical) so I'm specially excited to learn to use Github :) 

This is what I'm currently working on: 
- Learn about Github as a company, culture, people, etc.
- Get comfortable using GitHub and enjoy it! âœ¨
- Taking it day by day with an overload of info ðŸ˜†

Once my onboarding is completed I will work with the SMB team (sales) on making sure our customers sign on-time renewals and help them grow and upsell. 

Excited to continue to learn, grow, and to get started with my team and customers!
